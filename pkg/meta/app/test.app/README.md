# `test.app`: a test application blockchain

It's frustrating to make changes to the metanode code and then discover that
they're buggy only later, when testing the affected chaosnode / ndaunode
implementations of the update.

What we need is an example application, tightly integrated into the metanode repo,
with which we can demonstrate basic functionality.

This is that.
